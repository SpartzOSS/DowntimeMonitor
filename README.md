DowntimeMonitor
===============

Use this for the custom Monitor widget in Geckoboard.com's dashboards.

Returns "Up" or "Down", response time, time since last downtime (tracked in local txt files in the same directory for simplicity).

Pass in a query string parameter "url=http://www.example.com" to get the status of the desired url.
